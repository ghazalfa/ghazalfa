# Hi 👋  <br>   <br>  I'm Ghazal, a Biomedical Engineering Student Specializing in CS! 

### I'm especially passionate about the intersection of Medicine and CS, but really I'm always eager to learn about new technologies!

I'm currently an **embedded software engineer** for UBC Bionics where we are engineering a **bionic arm** 🦾

Spent my summer developing a **Signal Processing tool** in Rust for implantable biosensors 👩‍💻

I'm always open to chat! Feel free to  reach out to me on linkedin [@ghazal fallahpour](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghazal-fallahpour-67990918a/), or by email ghazalfa@icloud.com 🙂
